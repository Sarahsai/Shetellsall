    <span class="v14_86">I cannot believe you did this to me! How could you cheat on me with someone else? I trusted you completely and you went behind my back and betrayed me. You have caused me so much pain and heartbreak, and I don't know how I will ever be able to trust anyone again.
I thought we had something special, something real, but now I realize that it was all a lie. How could you be so selfish and cruel? Did you ever think about how your actions would affect me? How much it would hurt me to find out that you were with someone else?
 You have shown me that you are not the person I thought you were, and I don't know if I can ever look at you the same way again.
I hope you are happy with your new little friend, because you have lost me forever. pretty bold of you to cheat on someone who tells it all lets hope I don’t tell all about you. kisses xx
Goodbye,</span>
